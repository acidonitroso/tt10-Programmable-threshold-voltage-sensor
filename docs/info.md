## How it works

This programmable threshold voltage comparator allows comparing a voltage provided externally by the user (**Vref** signal) with a voltage level (threshold). The threshold voltage selection is controlled by 3 digital signals (**in[0], in[1]** and **in[2]** signals), which allow selecting one of the 8 possible threshold voltage levels. 7 of these levels are fixed (from 001 to 111 code), and only one (000 code) can be set by the user (**in0** signal). 

The output voltage (**out** signal) will be high (1.8V) when the selected threshold voltage is lower than **Vref** (**Vth < Vref**); otherwise, it will be low (0V).

The image below gives a simple overview of the entire project.

We can see all used components. We have **8 equal resistors** whom provide fixed thresholds for **7 passgates**. The one at the bottom is linked to external pin **in0** for free user voltage threshold. Every passgate is built using Pmos and Nmos both. 
Every passgate's gates are linked to **decoder**, who provides direct and negative signal to enable or disable each passgate. 

Values of resistance and fixed voltage thresholds can be read opening **xschem/analog.sch** file with **xschem**.

The next section explains how **Voltage comparator** is made.

## Voltage comparator 

![Voltage comparator](Voltage_comparator.png)
![](Voltage_comparator_layout.png)

Compare inputs between 0 and 1.8 V on both Vref and outpg. The output goes to 1.8 V (logic 1) if Vref > outpg; otherwise, it goes to 0 V (logic 0).

|      | Min | Max | 1 logic | 0 logic |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Output current | - | 150μA | - | - |
| Vref | 0V | 1.8V | - | - |
| outpg | 0V | 1.8V | - | - |
| out | 0V | 1.8V | - | - |
| Zout | - | - | ~ 11.5KΩ| ~ 2.8KΩ |



## Decoder 3 to 8

![Decoder](decoder.png)

In **verilog/rtl** folder you can find the verilog file used to generate **gds/decoder_p.gds** and gate level verilog file (in gl folder). Note that **hardening process** (who creates **.gds** and GL file) was made using commands of MakeFile contained in Matt Venn's R2R DAC example's (https://github.com/mattvenn/tt06-analog-r2r-dac). 

## Performance

Rise time of **out** signal (from 0.2V to 1.6V) is 8.5ns. 

Fall time of **out** signal (from 1.6V to 0.2V) is 19ns.

Maximum switching frequency of all input signals (even if they switch all at the same time) is **100KHz**, i.e. all signals can switch at the same time, but the fastest one MUST NOT exced 100KHz. 

|      | Min | Max | Typical |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| VDPWR | - | - | 1.8V |
| VGND | - | - | 0V |
| Vref | 0V | 1.8V | - |
| in0 | 0V | 1.8V | - | - |
| Switching frequency (all inputs) | - | 100KHz | - |
| Rise time | - | - | 8.5ns |
| Fall time | - | - | 19ns |

## How to test
- **VDPWR** voltage (supply voltage): 1.8V

- **VGND** voltage (supply voltage): 0V

- **Vref** voltage range (voltage reference for comparison): 0V to 1.8V

- **in0** voltage range (free voltage threshold): 0V to 1.8V

- **in[0], in[1], in[2]** (digital inputs): 0V (logically 0), 1.8V (logically 1)

- Maximum switching frequency of all input signals (even if they switch all at the same time) is 100KHz.
